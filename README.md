Microsoft Clone is a website designed to emulate the look and feel of the Microsoft official website.It is designed to have the same navigation structure, layout, and features as the Microsoft website.
The goal of the Microsoft Clone website is to understand how code is written in the background. This clone helps to study the code and use it as a reference point when creating our own websites that are
similar in structure and design.
